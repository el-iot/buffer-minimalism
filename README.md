<h1> Buffer-Minimalism </h1>

A simple vim-plugin for closing those buffers you've been compulsively hoarding. With its default configuration, the plug exposes a function "BufferMinimalism" which will close any buffers that haven't been opened or written to in the past 5 minutes.

That's it! My first vim-plugin.
